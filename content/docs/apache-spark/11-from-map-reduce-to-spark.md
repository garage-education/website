## Lesson objectives

In this lesson, we will explain the following topics:
- Understand the basic idea and stages of MapReduce.
- Learn about the limitations of MapReduce and the motivation for Spark.
- Explore the improvements offered by Spark over MapReduce, including in-memory processing and optimized execution.

## From MapReduce to Apache Spark

### The basic idea of MapReduce

- Assume we need to launch a high-throughput bulk-production sandwich shop.
- This sandwich has a lot of raw ingredients, and our target is to produce the sandwich as quickly as possible.
- To make the production very quickly we need to distribute the tasks between the *workers*.

### The basic idea of MapReduce

We break this into three stages:
- Map.
- Shuffle/Group (Mapper Intermediates).
- Reduce.

### Map

We distribute our raw ingredients amongst the workers.

### Shuffle/Group

We will organise and group the processed ingredients into piles, so that making a sandwich becomes easy.

### Reduce

Weâ€™ll combine the ingredients into a sandwich.

### Spark Motivation

- In-Memory Processing.
- Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs): Spark uses RDDs to perform parallel operations on data stored across cluster nodes, minimizing disk I/O by keeping data in RAM.
- Optimized Execution (DAG execution engine): The DAG execution engine organizes computations efficiently, reducing unnecessary operations and combining tasks to lower data movement.
- Caching: Spark allows for the caching of intermediate data in memory, benefiting iterative algorithms that reuse data, thereby avoiding repetitive disk access.
- Advanced Optimization (Catalyst optimizer and Tungsten): With components like the Catalyst optimizer and Tungsten for memory and CPU efficiency, Spark streamlines execution, making it ideal for fast, iterative processing over big data.
