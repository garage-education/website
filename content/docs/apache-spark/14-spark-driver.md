## Lesson objectives

In this lesson, we will explain the following topics:
- Learn about the role and key functions of the Spark driver.
- Understand how the driver schedules and distributes tasks to executors.
- Explore the communication and resource management responsibilities of the driver.

## Spark Driver

The driver is the process `in the driver seat.`[^1] of your Spark Application.

[^1]: Spark: The Definitive Guide, Chapter 15.

### Spark Driver: Key functions

- It transforms all the Spark operations into DAG computations, schedules them, and distributes their execution as tasks across the Spark executors.
- Controlling the execution of a Spark Application.

### Spark Driver: Key functions

- Acting as a process on a physical machine, responsible for the overall state of the application on the cluster.
- It instantiates the `SparkSession`.
- It requests resources (CPU, memory, etc.) from the cluster manager for Sparkâ€™s executors (JVMs).
- Once the resources are allocated, it communicates directly with the executors.
