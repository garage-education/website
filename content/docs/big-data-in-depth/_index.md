## About "Big Data Engineering in Depth"

The Big Data in Depth is a free online course which aims to share knowledge in the big data and data engineering. 
It focuses on taking you from the zero levels to be a professional in the field.

The course starts by explaining the Data Engineering and Distributed systems as basic billers. 
Then it goes throw different topics, including but not limited to Big Data tools, DevOps, Docker,
 Functional Programming, Scala, Spark, Kafka, Data Orchestrations, Elastics, and Architecture design.

All the material is available on Google classroom and Github. It includes lots of practical demos and coding sessions to
 get you to excel and understand these topics.
