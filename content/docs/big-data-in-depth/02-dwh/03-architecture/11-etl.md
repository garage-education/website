### What is ETL?

-   The ETL is the process of

    -   **Extracting**: the data from one or more source system

    -   **Transformation**: apply some rules over the extracted data
        including

        -   Cleansing ex: remove null, or trim spaces.

        -   Drop duplicates.

        -   joining with lookups to validate values or enrich the data.

        -   Reshaping or changing the data structure.

        -   Adding new columns or removing columns from these data.

        -   Change of data granularity.

        -   Convert data types.

    -   **Loading**: loading the transformed data into the target table
        based on the required format.

### What is ETL?

-   The ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) is the primary core
    function for any data engineering (DWH) team.

-   This team takes the delivered output from the previous stage (data
    modeling) and start to implement the mapping.

-   The implementation of the ETL preferred to be unified across the
    team members and the organization.

### Why?

Why ETL become mandatory in any DWH system? Because of the rapidly
increase in the data volumes, and the variety of the data types
structure, semi-structure, and non-structure data.

### ETL Characteristics

-   Successful ETL design have the following characteristics:

    -   Maintainable.

    -   Reusable.

    -   Well-Performed.

    -   Reliable.

    -   Resilient.

    -   Secure.

### ETL Best Practice

-   The keys to most of ETL implementation as following:

    -   **Auditing**

    -   **Managing Bad Data (Rejection Handling)**

    -   **Data Lineage**

    -   **Modularity**

    -   **Logging**

    -   **Error Handling**

    -   **Atomicity**

#### ETL Auditing

-   Example

    -   We have a billing source system and we need to integrate this
        source system in our DWH.

    -   Assume you get every day around 3M rows of data with total
        amount around 1M\$.

    -   Auditing helps us into three parts:

        -   Confirm the received rows are inserted into the target or
            (target + malformed = source).

        -   Identify the abnormal behavior if the source row changed
            maybe 3M (+/- 1%). The same metrics for the target and
            malformed records to be analyzed.

        -   Identify the abnormal behavior in the total aggregations,
            for example if we have a peak up to the total amount more
            than the normal (+/- 5%).


-   Auditing: The most important key to have a well-designed ETL
    architecture is to support the auditing row counts, aggregation, and
    other metrics based on the business and the use case. The first and
    most important quality gate is based on the auditing.

    -   Auditing help identifying the data abnormalities even if the ETL
        job doesn't have any errors.

    -   Auditing implementation differs between systems based on the use
        case.

    -   It is Customized based on the source system's criticality that
        could add more auditing metrics.

    -   We could extend auditing functions to be queryable on database
        monitoring or dashboards.

#### ETL Logging

-   Logging: is key to any successful ETL architecture, and it requires
    implementing a general strategy for all projects.

    -   ETL logging includes logs of any activtities or events that
        occur in the ETL job before, during, and after every stage.

    -   Some of the ETL software tools have their logs for the ETL;
        however, it could extend to other logs added to enhanced the ETL
        logging.


-   What types of events or metrics do we need to capture during ETL
    logging?

    -   *Start and stop events*.

    -   *Status*

    -   *Errors and other exceptions*

    -   *Audit information*

    -   *Testing and debugging information*


-   Some consideration during the building of the logging strategy:

    -   How to make your logs **format** easy for analysis?

    -   Do you have a dashboard or tools for logs visualization, or will
        it be an ad-hoc fashion?

    -   Who is the audience for these logs, and what are their needs?

    -   Are there any security requirements or restrictions for data
        logging?

    -   What is the retention policy?

#### ETL: Managing Bad Data (Rejection Handling)

-   In some systems, you get a malformed data, and it needs special
    handling (not removing).

-   It means the data is not accurate or as expected when compared to
    the same source system.

-   If we use this data as-is, we are risk affecting the quality of the
    business reports.

-   To manage the malformed records, we need to apply the following
    steps

    -   Define what is the meaning by well-formed records or accurate
        record.

    -   Configure handling actions for the malformed records.

### ETL: Managing Bad Data (Rejection Handling)

-   Example

    -   We have a CSV file that contains 5 columns, and we need to apply
        the ETL on this file.

#### ETL Modularity

-   ETL architecture is not only the quality of data but also how the
    code is reusable and modularized.

-   ETL architecture is not only the quality of data but also how the
    code is reusable and modularized.

-   How to achieve this modularity?

    -   Design template jobs for each part of the system.

    -   Standard methods and strategy for common tasks such as logging,
        error handling, and rejecting handling.

    -   Reduce the duplicate code by creating common libraries for the
        ETL.

    -   Create common functionality for unit testing.


-   How does this affect the team?

    -   Maintainability.

    -   Debugging.

    -   Investigation.

    -   Testing.

    -   Sharing the tasks between the team.

-   This part is a continuous enhancement part.

#### ETL: Data Lineage

-   Data Lineage is an essential part of our process to understand how
    this data transformed and where this data originated.

-   It helps to make the trust in the data by connecting the target into
    the source.

-   It helps with data tracing at the row level.


ETL: Data Lineage Example

-   We have a CSV file that contains 5 columns and we need to apply ETL
    process for this file assume the name is 3g\_ercsn.csv it could be
    any name.

-   After process this file, we rename this file to be
    filename\_batch\_id.

|trns\_id | cell\_id | cust\_number | app | trns\_ts | batch\_id|

#### ETL Error Handling

-   Error handling answers a question, What should we do if the process
    failed?

-   It also shows can prevent failure and handle these errors.

-   We deal with errors using different strategies:

    -   Fail safe (a.k.a. graceful shutdown/stop).

    -   Fail fast.

    -   Design error handling framework it includes: prevention and
        response.

    -   Design framework dealing with error responses.

#### ETL Atomicity

-   Atomicity refers to breaking more significant parts into smaller
    individual parts.

-   It also refers to how to split bigger ETL process or job into
    smaller parts.

-   Implementation of the atomicity pattern involves the identification
    of business parts and how to split it into smaller units for proper
    execution.

-   We refer to the anti-pattern for atomicity by monolithic.

-   Atomicity requires the ETL engineer to have some overview of the
    whole project cycle and how we can split it without affecting the
    business.

ETL Atomicity

Why do we need Atomicity?

-   Maintainability and readability of the code.

-   It helps in code tracing, testing, and enhancing.

-   Agile development and parallel work.

-   Avoid a single failure job, which enhances performance and resource
    optimization.
